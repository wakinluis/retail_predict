# Data Cleaning and Transforming
The dataset consists of the costs of various agricultural commodities per province, with data collected for each month in two phases: the first phase (1st–5th day of the month) and the second phase (15th–17th of the month). The project utilizes datasets spanning from July 2024 to July 2025.

The provided Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for cleaning and transforming the dataset. It includes detailed steps for preprocessing, handling missing values, and restructuring the data to facilitate further analysis and visualization.
